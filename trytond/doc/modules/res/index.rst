Resource Module
###############

The *Resource Module* provides some basic resources that practically every
Tryton installation needs.
This includes the concept of the users that use a Tryton system and the groups
that they are gathered together in.
It also provides the functionality that lets users login, and allows access
restrictions to be setup which can limit what the users can see and do.
