Analytic Budget
===============

An *Analytic Budget* is used to define a financial plan for a set of
:doc:`Analytic Accounts <analytic_account:index>` over a defined period of time
and for a specific `Company <company:model-company.company>`.

A budget is made up from budget lines which define the budgeted amount for an
:doc:`Analytic Account <analytic_account:index>`.
These lines can be grouped under another line to form a tree structure that
sums up the amounts.

The actual amount of the budget lines is calculated from the debits and credits
that are made to the budgetâ€™s analytic accounts.
