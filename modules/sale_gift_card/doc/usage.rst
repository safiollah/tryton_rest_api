.. _Selling gift cards:

Selling gift cards
==================

A gift card `Product <concept-product>` can sold on a `Sale
<sale:model-sale.sale>`.
When it is a service, the `Gift Card <model-sale.gift_card>` are created and
sent automatically by email to the email address from the sale line or, if this
has not been filled in, to the customer's email address.
When the *Product* is goods, the *Gift Cards* must be linked to the outgoing
`Stock Moves <model-stock.move>` that send the gift card to the customer.

.. _Redeeming gift card:

Redeeming gift card
===================

Existing `Gift Cards <model-sale.gift_card>` can be added once to a `Sale
<sale:model-sale.sale>`.
On quotation, a return line for the amount of each gift card is created.

.. note::

   If the value of the redeemed gift cards exceeds the value of the sale then
   the sales total will be negative.
   This will normally result in a credit note being generated by the sale
   instead of an `Invoice <account_invoice:model-account.invoice>`.
