The *Google Maps Module* extends the following concepts:

.. _model-party.address:

Address
=======

When the *Google Maps Module* is activated, the *Address* gains a new property
that calculates the :abbr:`URL (Uniform Resource Locator)` which opens Google
Maps pointing to that address.

.. seealso::

   The `Address <party:model-party.address>` concept is introduced by the
   :doc:`Party Module <party:index>`.
