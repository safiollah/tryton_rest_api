Send feedback
=============

When the generated record has been verified, you can send feedback to the OCR
service using the :guilabel:`Send Feedback` button.

This is done automatically for :guilabel:`Unknown` type when the resulted
`Incoming Document <document_incoming:model-document.incoming>` is processed
and for :guilabel:`Supplier Invoice` type when the resulted Supplier `Invoice
<account_invoice:model-account.invoice>` is validated or posted.
