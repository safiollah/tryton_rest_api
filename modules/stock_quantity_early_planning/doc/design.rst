Stock Quantity Early Plan
=========================

*Quantity Early Plannings* are generated by the `wizard
<wizard-stock.quantity.early_plan.generate>` of the same name.
They represent possible planning optimisation regarding the quantity of stock
available for future `Shipments <stock:concept-stock.shipment>`,
:doc:`Productions <production:index>` or `Outgoing Moves
<stock:model-stock.move>`.

Possible early dates are calculated for the planning.
Ignoring the proposal makes that the system will no more create proposal for
the origin.

The `Employee <company:model-company.employee>` who processes, closes or
ignores the planning is recorded.
