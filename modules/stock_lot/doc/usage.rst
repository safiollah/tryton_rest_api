Viewing stock levels
====================

Depending on what you are trying to find out you can get information about
stock levels for either `Lots <model-stock.lot>` or `Locations
<stock:model-stock.location>`.

If you are interested in finding out where some particular lots are stored,
then once you have selected the lots you are interested in, you can use the
menu items :guilabel:`Stock Locations` in the lot's :guilabel:`Open related
records` menu.

To view how much lots is in one or more stock locations you first need to
select the locations you are interested in.
Once you have done this you can use the :guilabel:`Lots` itm from the
:guilabel:`Open related records` menu.
This then shows the total stock of each lot that is in all the selected locations.

.. tip::

   From the [:menuselection:`Inventory & Stock --> Locations`] main menu item
   you can quickly get a list of lots in a single location by opening the
   location you are interested in.

.. tip::

   If you have only selected a single location then the stock levels will
   include all the stock in the location's children as well.
   However, if you selected multiple locations then only the stock in the
   selected locations is included, any stock in their child locations is
   *not* included.
