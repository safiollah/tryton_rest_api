The *Stock Quantity Issue Module* introduces the following concepts:

.. _model-stock.quantity.issue:

Stock Quantity Issue
====================

*Quantity Issues* are generated by a *Scheduled Task*.
They represent planning issues regarding the quantity of stock available for
future `Shipments <stock:concept-stock.shipment>` or :doc:`Productions
<production:index>`.

A best planned date is calculated for each issue.
Applying this date updates the shipment's, or production's, planned date.
The issue also lists the `Products <product:concept-product>` for which there
is a quantity issue.

The `Employee <company:model-company.employee>` who processes or solves the
issue is recorded.

   Quantity Issues can be found by opening the main menu item:

      |Inventory & Stock --> Quantity Issues|__

      .. |Inventory & Stock --> Quantity Issues| replace:: :menuselection:`Inventory & Stock --> Quantity Issues`
