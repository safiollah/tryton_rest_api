Commission Waiting Module
#########################

The *Commission Waiting Module* allows an account move to be generated for each
commission between the expense/revenue account and a waiting account defined on
the agent.
When the commission invoice is posted the waiting account is cleared using the
payable/receivable account of the invoice.
